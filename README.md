# Hydra code generator in typescript

A port from the @alecominotti python version

# Original project
- https://hydracg.herokuapp.com/
- https://github.com/alecominotti/hydracodegenerator

**Not ported**: In the original port one may run a local server and control hydra from there

# TODO:

- One shouldn't be able to mark the same function as _exclusive_ and _ignored_ at the same time, currently there is no error capturing for this
- Remove many @ts-ignore comments
- Add keymaps for evaluation
### Other functions 

That I would like to add:
